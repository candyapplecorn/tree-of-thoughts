# tree-of-thoughts

A tree of thoughts implementation in typescript.

Here's a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/QLJtfH8oGjk) of me detailing the "Tree of Thoughts" framework

## Goals

I'd like to make a Typescript implementation of the tree of thoughts framework.

I'd like to add interfaces for the memory module, for allowing backtracking any amount of times, and specifying the tree traversal algorithm, among other things. After all, when you remove the LLM portion of this framework, you're left with just a somewhat complicated data structure you could find in any computer science class. Not literally this one... It's just a tree with special nodes ^_^

## Why are you doing this?

The burnout is alleviating I guess? Just seems like a fun little thing to pass time.

## Why use Create React App?

I just wanted an out of the box template that'd have typescript and unit testing working. I didn't want to spend time reinventing the wheel by writing and wrestling with tsconfig, jest config etc.

Heck, maybe I'll add some visualization stuff later. Meh
